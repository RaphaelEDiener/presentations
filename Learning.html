There are a few underlying ways we might build mental models,

Neurons that fire together, bind together.</p>

# Failure
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>But ok, there is a second option.<br>one more powerful than the first one.<br>And that is failure.      </p>
<p>Failing is the best thing that can happen in your learning.<br>Some prominent voices also argue that it&#39;s the only way you can ever learn anything.      </p>
<p>Back in our internal map example:<br>If you took the wrong turn once,<br>you will remember that spot the next day with:<br>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s the spot I took the wrong turn&quot;.      </p>
<p>The memory associated will be stronger and more salient.      </p>
<p>But this is not something you can do inside a 15 minute presentation.      </p>
<p>There is only one fail state for you and that is not listening.<br>And even if I bore you so much that you start sleeping,<br>this isn&#39;t a real fail state, is it?<br>The only thing you do during a presentation is listen.<br>And you&#39;ve mastered that skill hopefully in the Kindergarten.      </p>
<p>You won&#39;t be learning something <em>new</em> inside a 15 minute presentation.      </p>

<aside class="notes"><p>And we can see how integral failure is to learning when examining Anki as a case study.</p>
<p>You make flashcards to help you remember knowledge.
Not even understanding.
And yet, for effective memorization of knowledge, the cornerstone is not really repetition,
but failure.
Flashcards are made for you to fail.</p>
<p>Hence the 4 buttons at the bottom of the screen describe how hard you&#39;ve failed.</p>
<p>And we know that flashcards are the most effective way to gain knowledge,
since it is used my medical students all around the globe for exactly this reason.</p>
<p>So if even repetition pails in comparison to failing, it becomes even more obvious,
that you won&#39;t learn something from a 15 minute presentation.</p>

# Japanese

<aside class="notes"><p>By this point you have surely realized, that I&#39;ve played a joke on you.
This was all part of my presentation and I&#39;ve not run out of slides.</p>
<p>But since we are already here, indulge me for a second talking about my study of the Japanese language.
For the N4 test I learned a total of 1500 words.
I knew them all for the exam.</p>
<p>If you were to ask me now how many of those I&#39;d remember,
I would be impressed with myself if I were able to remember one fifth.</p>
<p>But if we talk about programming,
I&#39;m pretty sure I could tell you about <strong>All</strong> of my failures.
You could throw me into a new language I&#39;ve never seen before and I would be productive at the end of the same day.</p>

# Quality of Learning
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>The answer is, that not all learning is created equally.
I already mentioned it earlier, but learning through failure is considered better than learning through repetition.
But why?</p>
<p>The answer is that learning through failure builds understanding.
Knowledge is the necessary precondition to understanding, but it is not sufficient.
The only way to create understanding is the play with something and explore its limitations.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t learn anything from a 15 minute presentation.</p>
<p>TODO: insert something something paradigm -&gt; link to subjects @ school/uni</p>
<p>Wait a minute.
I&#39;m pretty sure, we all know a place were we spend a lot of time getting talked to a lot,
under the pretense that we should be able to learn something.</p>

# College
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>But if we entertain the facts I mentioned previously seriously,
then we can not help but end up with the realization,
that teaching is one of the biggest obstruction to learning there is.</p>
<p>That sheds a unconformable light on what you guys have been doing for the past few years,
doesn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>Because you will not learn something from a 1 and a half hour lecture.</p>
<p>I mean, I&#39;ve learned a lot from conference talks, lectures and video recordings,
but none of that from the first time listening.
When I resonate with something or think there was something of meaning inside that piece of content,
I read, listen, watch it again and again and again hoping that I can retain the knowledge for long enough,
until I&#39;m able to understand it.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s not something you can do in the lectures I&#39;m taking this semester, 
because no lecturer records any of their lectures!</p>
<p>And you will not be able to learn something by listening to their 1 and a half hour lecture for the first time.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>By now I&#39;ve hopefully established that repetition is the minimum 
and the knowledge gained through it is ephemeral.
It becomes obvious that this thing is the most destructive thing you could ever use as a student.
As a student your job is to learn.</p>
<p>Even if the teacher gives you tasks to fail at,
if you repeatedly use an LLM to answer the questions,
thinking, that the repetitive reading of the answers will make you learn,
you are setting yourself up for failing not in school, but in life.</p>
<p>You will learn nothing from reading an pre stated answer.</p>

In the hopes that you remember what I said today every time, 
you hear one of the other presentations that come after me.</p>

that you then also take the time to download their transcription,
