# Real OOP

Raphael Diener 29.04.24

note:

I originally wanted to talk to you about Object oriented programming.
I had all the slides prepared with jokes and infographics and mnemonics, and stuff.
But I was on a stroll in the woods, when I noticed the profound uselessness of the talk.

# ~~Real OOP~~

*You can't learn anything from a 15 minute presentation*     
Raphael Diener 29.04.24

note:

So I'm doing none of that today.
Instead I'm gonna talk to you about why you can't learn anything from a 15 minute presentation,
using a 15 minute presentation.

# Leaning

note:

Neurology tells us that we learn by building mental models in our head.
There are a few underlying ways we might build mental models,
but the most primitive and effective one is:
Neurons that fire together, bind together.

And this will most likely not be the case in a 15 minute presentation

note:

Let's take the example of making a mental map.      
The first day at UCB you were probably a bit disorientated.      
You walked around until you found your lecture room.      
      
The second time was faster and the path got strengthen.      
      
Then after you have walked the path multiple times,      
it is strongly physically wired inside your brain.

# Repetition

note:

*"So repetition is required to strengthen connections between neurons.      
We get it"*      
      
Yes, but this not something I can do.      
If I were to constantly repeat myself, I'd probably only get you bored and a bad grade too.      
      
And if I don't you won't take anything away.      
      
You won't be learning anything from a 15 minute presentation.

# Failure

note:

But ok, there is a second option.      
one more powerful than the first one.      
And that is failure.      
      
Failing is the best thing that can happen in your learning.      
Some prominent voices also argue that it's the only way you can ever learn anything.      
      
Back in our internal map example:      
If you took the wrong turn once,       
you will remember that spot the next day with:      
"Oh, that's the spot I took the wrong turn".      
      
The memory associated will be stronger and more salient.      
      
But this is not something you can do inside a 15 minute presentation.      
      
There is only one fail state for you and that is not listening.      
And even if I bore you so much that you start sleeping,      
this isn't a real fail state, is it?      
The only thing you do during a presentation is listen.      
And you've mastered that skill hopefully in the Kindergarten.      
      
You won't be learning something *new* inside a 15 minute presentation.

note:

And we can see how integral failure is to learning when examining Anki as a case study.

You make flashcards to help you remember knowledge.
Not even understanding.
And yet, for effective memorization of knowledge, the cornerstone is not really repetition,
but failure.
Flashcards are made for you to fail.

Hence the 4 buttons at the bottom of the screen describe how hard you've failed.

And we know that flashcards are the most effective way to gain knowledge,
since it is used my medical students all around the globe for exactly this reason.

So if even repetition pails in comparison to failing, it becomes even more obvious,
that you won't learn something from a 15 minute presentation.

# Thanks for listening to my TED talk

note:

So, this was pretty much all I have to say on this matter.
But since we have so much time left,
how about we spend the rest of the time talking about the original topic.

---

# OOP

note:

Hands up. How many of you think Java is an object oriented language. 
Cpp?
,...

Huh, that's curious.
Those languages are class based, not object based.


Don't you find it curious how you all said they were object oriented?

---

# Repetition legitimizes

note:

I'd recon it has something to do with this. Doesn't it?

You've heard this factoid repeated so often, that you didn't even question it.

So the question becomes not only, why you repeated that piece of misinformation,
but why the people who told you that, also repeated that piece of misinformation them selfs.

---

![[Pasted image 20240422004042.png]]

note:

And the answer is, that you can't learn something from a 1 hour presentation.

When OOP started to emerge in the 80s, 
there were only a hand full of small talk programmers and a couple erlang programmers,
who actually understood what object orientation meant.

---

![[Pasted image 20240413214152.png]]

note:


Then they went to a conference or gave seminars on that topic and as expected,
people didn't learned anything from listening to them.

And here I was foolishly thinking, that I could do better.
Better than over 40 years of knowledge transmission did before me.

You would have learned nothing from a 15 minute presentation.

---

# Japanese

note:

By this point you have surely realized, that I've played a joke on you.
This was all part of my presentation and I've not run out of slides.

But since we are already here, indulge me for a second talking about my study of the Japanese language.
For the N4 test I learned a total of 1500 words.
I knew them all for the exam.

If you were to ask me now how many of those I'd remember,
I would be impressed with myself if I were able to remember one fifth.

But if we talk about programming,
I'm pretty sure I could tell you about **All** of my failures.
You could throw me into a new language I've never seen before and I would be productive at the end of the same day.

Why is that?

---

# Quality of Learning

note:

The answer is, that not all learning is created equally.
I already mentioned it earlier, but learning through failure is considered better than learning through repetition.
But why?

The answer is that learning through failure builds understanding.
Knowledge is the necessary precondition to understanding, but it is not sufficient.
The only way to create understanding is the play with something and explore its limitations.

You can't learn anything from a 15 minute presentation.

TODO: insert something something paradigm -> link to subjects @ school/uni

Wait a minute.
I'm pretty sure, we all know a place were we spend a lot of time getting talked to a lot,
under the pretense that we should be able to learn something.

---

# College

note:

But if we entertain the facts I mentioned previously seriously,
then we can not help but end up with the realization,
that teaching is one of the biggest obstruction to learning there is.

That sheds a unconformable light on what you guys have been doing for the past few years,
doesn't it?

Because you will not learn something from a 1 and a half hour lecture.

I mean, I've learned a lot from conference talks, lectures and video recordings,
but none of that from the first time listening.
When I resonate with something or think there was something of meaning inside that piece of content,
I read, listen, watch it again and again and again hoping that I can retain the knowledge for long enough,
until I'm able to understand it.

But that's not something you can do in the lectures I'm taking this semester, 
because no lecturer records any of their lectures!

And you will not be able to learn something by listening to their 1 and a half hour lecture for the first time.

Note:

By now I've hopefully established that repetition is the minimum 
and the knowledge gained through it is ephemeral.
It becomes obvious that this thing is the most destructive thing you could ever use as a student.
As a student your job is to learn.

Even if the teacher gives you tasks to fail at,
if you repeatedly use an LLM to answer the questions,
thinking, that the repetitive reading of the answers will make you learn,
you are setting yourself up for failing not in school, but in life.

You will learn nothing from reading an pre stated answer.

"*But its like a dictionary in better*".
Yes, if you want your dictionaries to lie to your face with high confidence, that is.

note:

The **only** thing correct in the explanations given is the syntax example.
Statement one and two are wrong.

But why will ChatGPT vehemently defend the definition it has given you?

---

# Repetition

note:

But in the end it all comes down to this.
Repetition.

The sources it was trained on repeated that information multiple times,
so it is sure, that it is correct.
And the same way repetition of wrong facts propagates the myth that Java, C++ and C#
are object oriented,
the same way all LLMs will propagate wrong information about almost every topic.

You will learn nothing by using a LLM.

---

# Be excellent

note:

I've decided to use my opportunity as the first talk,
to enable the message to get across.
In the hopes that you remember what I said today every time, 
you hear one of the other presentations that come after me.

That if you find anything meaningful in the things that get presented here,
that you then also take the time to download their transcription,
and read it again and again until you are able to unterstand what they have been trying to say.

You won't have learned something from this,
but maybe, maybe, you will remember something from this 15 minute presentation.
