# Failure
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>But repetition alone is not enough.<br>What repetition can give you is nothing more than knowledge.<br>Repetition can&#39;t give you understanding.<br>Understanding comes from failure.      </p>
<p>Failing is the best thing that can happen in your learning.<br>Some prominent voices also argue that it&#39;s the only way you can ever learn anything.      </p>
<p>Back in our internal map example:<br>If you took the wrong turn once,<br>you will remember that spot the next day with:<br>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s the spot I took the wrong turn&quot;.      </p>
<p>The memory associated will be stronger and more salient.      </p>
<p>But this is not something you can do inside a 15 minute presentation.      </p>
<p>There is only one fail state for you and that is not listening.<br>And even if I bore you so much that you start sleeping,<br>this isn&#39;t a real fail state, is it?<br>The only thing you do during a presentation is listen.<br>And you&#39;ve mastered that skill hopefully in the Kindergarten.      </p>
<p>You won&#39;t be learning something <em>new</em> inside a 15 minute presentation.      </p>

<aside class="notes"><p>And we can see how integral failure is to learning when examining Anki as a case study.      </p>
<p>You make flashcards to help you remember knowledge.<br>Not even understanding.<br>And yet, for effective memorization of knowledge, the cornerstone is not really repetition,<br>but repeated failure.<br>Flashcards are made for you to fail.      </p>
<p>And we know that flashcards are (one of) the most effective way to gain knowledge,<br>since it is used my medical students all around the globe for exactly this reason.      </p>
<p>So if even repetition pails in comparison to failing, it becomes even more obvious,<br>that you won&#39;t learn something from a 15 minute presentation.</p>

# OOP

<aside class="notes"><p>Do you think Java is an object oriented language.<br>Cpp? C-sharp?      </p>
<p>Huh, that&#39;s curious.<br>Those languages are class based, not object based.      </p>
<p>Don&#39;t you find it curious why many peaople say that they are object oriented?      </p>
<p>sources:</p>
<p>Yes, it really is commonly spread misinformation.
For my original presentation I went ahead and took a look at the first few distinkt google search resutls.
They stated the wrongly what OOP was meant to be 
and then following that quotes languages that fit their made up feaure list.</p>

<p>The definition by assoziation is meaningless but lets pick polymorphism as an example,
mostly because I like that word.
There are multiple different kinds of polymorphism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subtype Polymorphism</li>
<li>Parametric Polymorphism</li>
<li>Ad Hoc Polymorphism</li>
<li>Row Polymorphism</li>
<li>(Rank Polymorphism)</li>
<li>(Coercion Polymorphism)</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)">Wikipedia - Polymorphism</a></p>
<p>Lets make the assoziation as broad as possible and say that as long as it supports any kind of polimorphism,
it is considered an OOP-language.
Even then I can make a language that adheres to a better definition of OOP 
by the creator (<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?AlanKaysDefinitionOfObjectOriented">wiki.c2</a>)
and doesn&#39;t implement any kind of polimorphism.</p>
<p>I&#39;m actually doing that right now to test out different schedulers.

# Repetition legitimizes

<aside class="notes"><p>I&#39;d recon it has something to do with this. Doesn&#39;t it?      </p>

<p>When OOP started to emerge in the 80s,<br>there were only a hand full of small talk programmers and a couple erlang programmers,<br>who actually understood what object orientation meant.      </p>
<p>sources:</p>
<p>Here are some links describing how Erlang and Small-Talk work.

<aside class="notes"><p>Then they went to a conference or gave seminars on that topic and as expected,<br>people didn&#39;t learned anything from listening to them.      </p>
<p>People came from a mostly Algol, Fortran and Cobol background.<br>And when they saw all those foreign things inside OOP,<br>they latched onto what they already knew.<br>And that was structs.      </p>
<p>When people came back to the office, all they remembered was<br>&quot;<em>something something classes</em>&quot;.      </p>
<p>And here I was foolishly thinking, that I could do better.<br>Better than over 40 years of knowledge transmission did before me.<br>If you want people to learn something, they have to have an foundation already,<br>on which your new thing fits.<br>If you have something new which they can&#39;t intuit, they will not take it away.      </p>
<p>And like the programmers in the 80s, your foundation is in C.      </p>

# Quality of Learning
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>The answer is, that not all learning is created equally.<br>I already mentioned it earlier, but learning through failure is considered better than learning through repetition.<br>But why?      </p>
<p>The length of retention is directly correlated to the amount of connected information.<br>When you build understanding you do that explorative.<br>You have a central question or topic and then go explore in wieldy different directions.<br>The end result is a highly interconnected web of information,
as well as meta information about how you acquired that knowledge in the first place.      </p>
<p>You can&#39;t learn anything from a 15 minute presentation.      </p>
<p>Wait a minute.<br>I&#39;m pretty sure, we all know a place were we spend a lot of time getting talked to a lot,<br>under the pretense that we should be able to learn something.      </p>

<p>The keyword thats related to this one is &quot;Verarbeitungstiefe&quot; in the german literature.

# College
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>But if we entertain the facts I mentioned previously seriously,<br>then we can not help but end up with the realization,<br>that teaching is one of the biggest obstruction to learning there is.      </p>
<p>While you are getting taught you can&#39;t explore different paths.<br>You can&#39;t answer burning questions required for your understanding.<br>If you have sat in school for long enough you even learn to stop asking those questions in the first place.<br>You have regressed the ability to understand where your own knowledge lacks,<br>and how to ask the questions to fill in those gaps.      </p>
<p>That sheds a unconformable light on what you guys have been doing for the past few years,<br>doesn&#39;t it?      </p>
<p>Because you will not learn something from a 1 and a half hour lecture.      </p>
<p>I mean, I&#39;ve learned a lot from conference talks, lectures and video recordings,<br>but none of that from the first time listening.<br>When I resonate with something or think there was something of meaning inside that piece of content,<br>I read, listen, watch it again and again and again hoping that I can retain the knowledge for long enough,<br>until I&#39;m able to understand it.      </p>
<p>But that&#39;s not something you can do in the lectures I&#39;m taking this semester,<br>because no lecturer records any of their lectures!      </p>
<p>And you will not be able to learn something by listening to their 1 and a half hour lecture for the first time.      </p>

I sadly can&#39;t quote one or two resources for this claim, 
since it will play out in many different ways depending on where you look.
Even tho the general picture will remain, I personally know of no meta study to link.
Hence the link should take you to a collection of different revelant materials for you to continue your reasearch,
into the topics you find relevant.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>By now I&#39;ve hopefully established that repetition is the minimum<br>and the knowledge gained through it is ephemeral.<br>Also, engagement is critical to uncover your own lack of understanding<br>and to fill in the foundation on which new information can rest.      </p>
<p>Under those aspects, It becomes obvious that this thing is the most destructive thing you could ever use as a student.<br>As a student your job is to learn.      </p>
<p>Even if the teacher gives you tasks to fail at,<br>if you repeatedly use an LLM to answer the questions,<br>thinking, that the repetitive reading of the answers will make you learn,<br>you are setting yourself up for failing not in school, but in life.      </p>
<p>You will learn nothing from reading an pre stated answer.      </p>

<aside class="notes"><p>The <strong>only</strong> thing correct in the explanations given is the syntax example.<br>Statement one and two are wrong.      </p>
<p>Chat jeopardy is a little toy which is useless.<br>Meaning it has not a single applicable use.      </p>
<p>But why will ChatGPT vehemently defend the definition it has given you?      </p>
<p>source:</p>
<p>Maybe first, why the pointer answer from OAI was wrong:
The problem is that we execute code on a computer, which has an operating system.
So most often, if you are going through the standart library,
you are using the OS features such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory">Virual Memory</a>.
Hence a pointer is simply something which lives one abstraction layer above the hardware.
There are ways of accessing memory directly which depend on the compiler and your target.</p>
<p>So while one could argue that the <code>pointer = memory adress</code> model is not completely wrong,
the model is wrong in all usecases a normal programmer encounters.
And if you are working in embeded software, you already know how to do it correctly.</p>
<p>Next is the part where I claim that LLM&#39;s are only <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">stochastic parrots</a>.
Well, thats just what multi layered neural nets are.
If you need an introduction to the field,
<a href="https://youtu.be/u7n9t1cBei8?si=_SZlbN9AzwEWuEUN">this gentle introduction</a> got you covered.</p>

# Repetition
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>But in the end it all comes down to this.<br>Repetition.      </p>
<p>The sources it was trained on repeated that misinformation multiple times,<br>so it is sure, that it is correct.<br>And the same way repetition of wrong facts propagates the myth that Java, C++ and C#<br>are object oriented,<br>the same way all LLMs will propagate wrong information about almost every topic.      </p>
<p>You will learn nothing by using a LLM.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>I&#39;ve decided to use my opportunity with this talk,<br>to enable the message to get across.<br>In the hopes that you remember what I said today every time,<br>you hear one of the other presentations that come after me.      </p>
<p>That if you find anything meaningful in the things that get presented here,<br>that you then also take the time to download their transcription,<br>and read it again and again until you are able to unterstand what they have been trying to say.      </p>
